# Agriplace - Frontend Assignment

## Introduction

This assignment is supposed to be a conversational piece, and it doesn't have to be perfect, so relax, and do not push yourself too hard.
Try not to spend more than four hours on it. We would like you to focus on the code, and not on the styling, so keep it simple
and minimal, even using standard html elements would be fine. If you feel more comfortable using a UI library, feel free
to do so. We use MUI in our project, but don't feel obliged to use it too if you are not familiar with it, we would rather have you
spend your time thinking, and coding instead of reading documentation. 
We want you to treat this assignment as a base for a bigger project, so try to keep the code clean, modular and extensible.
Don't worry if you cannot finish the assignment in the preferred timeframe (4 hours), we just want to see how you think, code, and why
you make the choices you make.

## The assignment

The assignment is to create a simple web application that has an admin panel and a public facing page. The admin panel
consists of two pages that are a basic CRUD, one for managing fruits and one for managing vegetables. The public facing
page is a simple page that lists all the products.
We would prefer that you use functional components and hooks. There is already a mockup of a backend as RTK Query 
endpoints, you can find it in the `src/app/api` folder, the endpoints have a fake delay so please also use loading 
states where you think is necessary. The mockup backend just saves the changes on localstorage, and there is also a 
function to reset the data to the initial state. There is also already a router and a basic layout of the app. 

### Admin panel

The admin panel should have two pages, one for managing fruits, and one for managing vegetables. The pages should have a
list/table of the relevant products, and you should be able to create, update and delete them - if you don't use a
UI framework, don't bother creating fancy modals if you think it would take too much of your time, a simple inline form
works as well. There should also be a search field that filters the list of products by looking in the title,
description and tags.

#### Creating and Editing

When creating a product, there should be a form with the following fields:

- Title
- Description
- Tags - as checkboxes ( fruits should show the fruit tags and vegetables should show the vegetable tags )

When editing a product, the form should be pre-filled with the current values of the product, it should have the same
fields as creating, including an "archived" checkbox which would hide the product from the public page.

### Public facing page

The public facing page consists of four sections:

- A list of all the fruits and vegetables
- A section to view the selected products
- A section that shows the cart's contents
- A section that shows the last 5 products that the user has viewed

#### List of products

The list should include all the non-archived fruits and vegetables along with a search field that filters the
products based on name, a list of tags that you can toggle to filter the results. The list should show the
name of the product and the tags as chips with their respective colors (just choose a color for each tag).
Clicking on a product should show the product in the product view.

#### Product view

The product view should have its own route, and should show a preview of the product in the "selected product" section.
It should show the name, description and tags of the product, along with a button that adds that product to the users
cart. When a product is added, the button should be replaced with a component that shows the number of times this
product was added to the cart, two buttons to increase/reduce the amount and one button to completely remove the product
from the cart.

#### Cart

The cart should be just a list of the products that the user has added to the cart, along with a controls to change the
amount and remove that product from the cart. The cart contents should be saved in a redux state.

#### Recently viewed

The recently viewed section should show a list of the last 5 products that the user has viewed, clicking on a product in
the list should bring that product in the product view. The recently viewed products should be saved in a redux state.
